Lay the wonton wrapper over the muffin tin and gently press it in with the bottom of the cup. My toddler's sippy cup is the perfect size.\\n\\nTip 2: if you're making these ahead of time, consider brushing the inside of the cup with a little olive or other light tasting oil - the oil will help stop the water in the dressing from soaking into the shell and making it soggy. \\n\\nTip 3: an ice cream scoop is the perfect size for easy dishing the salad into the wonton cups quickly.\",\n",

And though he&#039;s never expressed an opinion on how to rate a recipe, he kept saying &quot;You&#039;ve got to rate this a five...&quot;.  So five it is.  If I could give it more, I would.  Now, the finished dish is not exactly pretty or photogenic in any way, like most Shepherd&#039;s Pies.

I thought the dressing was great, but it really shined when tossed with the salad ingredients. I used the baby spinach as called for, and I also added some baby romaine. I didn\\'t have asiago cheese, but had some niced aged parmesan that I used instead.  The one ingredient that really made the salad was the sun dried tomatoes. Don\\'t leave them out!

       "  'review': '5 Stars and then some! Wow! Made this yesterday for my wife and I. I NEVER would have imagined that &quot;five cans&quot; could taste so good. I have been trying to lose weight, but I have not been looking for &quot;diet&quot; meals. I have been looking for healthy alternatives to fast food. This is amazingly good. \\n    What I actually did was combine this recipe with another, #57009 &quot;5 Cans and a Jar Soup Recipe&quot;. I highly recommend it! The added chicken broth and medium-hot salsa and kidney beans (I used one can of red, one white), and used fire-roasted diced tomatoes for additional flavor. A couple of sprigs of basil and a few bay leaves are the only additions I made. Combined, I was blown away. One of the most flavorful soups, -meals-, I have ever made! And really, &quot;no cooking&quot; is necessary! You are really just heating this up to meal temperature. Yes, I let it simmer a good hour or more, until my wife got home from work. I cannot recommend this enough! \\n    This is my new EASY, healthy, favorite! And my little dog, a &quot;schnoodle&quot;, LOVED it as well! :)',\n",

I added the macaroni with some water to the skillet and let it simmer (covered) just a couple more minutes for the macaroni to finish cooking and then added the cheese, which melted quickly.
